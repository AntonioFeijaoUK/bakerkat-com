This bake has been done by request from my neighbour.

As sometimes happens (a little too frequently) we turned up at the station to find every single train cancelled.

With few other options, we went back home, knocked on the door of neighbour Kevin (on a hope and a prayer), asking if he could drive us to the nearest dlr station. In return, I promised to make him whichever cake/pie/tart/pastry he'd like on the weekend.

He chose a Grasshopper pie, which I'd made (and shared) once before and that he was still thinking about. So Grasshopper pie it was, for that weeks bake.

Luckily, I had leftovers of both green crème de menthe and white crème de cacao - when I made it previously (for when my sister came to visit) I had to call two different <a href="https://www.oddbins.com/">Oddbin's </a>stores to reserve a bottle of each, respectively.

Recipe is from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nigella-Kitchen-Recipes-Heart-Collection-ebook/dp/B00P8K05VG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535360825&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=nigella+kitchen">Nigella</a> Kitchen.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

<em>Base:</em>

300g bourbon biscuits

50g chopped dark chocolate

50g softened, unsalted butter

<em>Filling</em>

150g mini marshmallows

125ml whole milk

60ml crème de menthe (green)

60ml crème de cacao (white)

375ml double cream

Green food colouring (I had only had green paste instead of drops, so the pie is not as psychedelic green as it could've been)

Use a 25cm fluted tart tin and make sure it has a loose base (I made that mistake with my first attempt)!

&nbsp;

<em>Step 1:</em>

Put aside one bourbon biscuit.

Blitz the rest in a food processor together with the chocolate and continue until it's all crumbs.

&nbsp;

Add the softened butter and blitz further until the butter and biscuit-chocolate mixture start to clump together.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 2:</em>

Press the clumpy mixture into the tin and press it well against the sides and bottom.

(the big chocolate piece in the middle is for <a href="https://feijaouk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antonio</a>).

Put the base in the fridge while making the filling.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 3:</em>

Mix marshmallows and milk in a saucepan over low heat.

&nbsp;

Once the milk is foaming, remove from the heat and stir until the marshmallows are mixed well into the milk to form a smooth mixture.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 4:</em>

Transfer the mix to heatproof bowl.

Add both cremè menthe and cacao, then leave cooling to room temperature.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 5:</em>

Whisk the cream. The peaks should hold well but still be soft.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" src="https://bakerkatcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/screen-shot-2018-09-11-at-22-07-10.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-09-11 at 22.07.10.png" width="910" height="1052" />

&nbsp;

Fold into the cooled marshmallow mix.

Once combined to a smooth, soft mixture, add the food colouring (optional). I only had the paste so the green colour is not as eye-catching as the drops could have made it.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-92" src="https://bakerkatcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/screen-shot-2018-09-11-at-22-11-48.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-09-11 at 22.11.48.png" width="1118" height="768" />

&nbsp;

<em>Step 6:</em>

Add the filling to the well-chilled base and spread it around evenly.

Return to the fridge and chill for a minimum of 4 hours (I find chilling for less time does not give a firm filling) or overnight, if possible.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 7:</em>

Once chilled, crush the saved bourbon biscuit and sprinkle over the pie as decoration, remove from the tart tin and serve!

Half a pie to keep the neighbour happy and a big thank you for the ride. And the rest for us :)

Hope you enjoy baking and eating!
