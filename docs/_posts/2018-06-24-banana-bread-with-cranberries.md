So, Sundays are family days in our home - even though it's only the two of us. And family day only starts around midday when Antonio wakes up (as he claims to study better during the night).

Which offers me an excellent chance to attempt a brunch option.

As lazy people, we sometimes have our weekly shop delivered but typing in `10x bananas` in the order often gives 16-17 of them - so banana bread it is! The original recipe called for dried cherries but it was cranberries I found in my cupboard.

Original recipe is from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nigella-Kitchen-Recipes-Heart-Collection-ebook/dp/B00P8K05VG/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529870076&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=nigella+kitchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nigella's Kitchen. </a>

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4 bananas - mashed</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">125g unsalted butter + extra for greasing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">150g caster sugar</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2 eggs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">175g plain flour</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2 tsp baking Soda</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1/2 tsp bicarbonate of Soda</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">100g dried cranberries (or cherries)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">100g desiccated coconut</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">900g tin loaf</p>
<em>Step 1: </em>

Pre-heat oven to 170°C.

Grease your tin loaf sides with butter. Cut out some baking paper and line the bottom of the tin.

<em>Step 2:</em>

In a saucepan, melt the butter. Once it's all melted, take off the heat to cool.

While the butter is cooling, mash the bananas.

<em>Step 3:</em>

Transfer the melted butter to a bowl and beat the sugar into it.

Beat the bananas and eggs into the butter/sugar mixture, then fold in flour, bicarbonate of soda and baking powder.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 4:</em>

Add the dried cranberries and coconut to the mix.

Fully mix all the ingredients together, then add the batter to the lined tin.

&nbsp;

<em>Step 5:</em>

Bake for 45 minutes, then check if the cake is done by sticking a skewer into the cake. If the skewer comes out clean, the cake is done.

If not, give it 5-10 minutes more.

Once out the oven, leave for 10 minutes to cool in the tin. Then remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.

<em>Step 6:</em>

When cooled, serve with some soft cheese and fruit spread. We had it with mascarpone, strawberries and rhubarb &amp; ginger conserve. And of course coffee!

&nbsp;

<em>Step 7:</em>

As fun as baking is, the last step is always the least inspiring... The cleaning.

Luckily, in our home we have a rule: The one who cooks does not clean! So time for me to kick back and relax and let Antonio finish the last step for me.

&nbsp;

Enjoy the baking (and subsequent eating)!
